# Team Website

Before it started to become a kind of portfolio, this website has been our **first Bootcamp project**. At that time, we were 5 trainees following a “8+4” weeks of [full-stack JavaScript practice](http://www.turnintocoders.it/en/bootcamp.html) in Turin, Italy.

This tiny “JavaScript free” first project was only intended to let us **experiment [Git](https://git-scm.com/) collaboration flow** by working all at the same time on the same HTML file!

Indeed, we went through **a lot of funny “[Oh shit Git!](http://ohshitgit.com/)”** while doing it, and we definitely hope that you'll have no less pleasure in browsing our projects portfolio now.
