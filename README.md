# Team Website

Before it started to become a kind of portfolio, this website has been our **first Bootcamp project**. At that time, we were 5 trainees following a “4+8+4 weeks” [practice of full-stack JavaScript](http://www.turnintocoders.it/en/bootcamp.html) coding in Turin, Italy.

This tiny “JavaScript-free” first project was only intend to let us **practice [Git](https://git-scm.com/) collaboration flow** by working all at the same time on the same HTML single file!

Indeed, we add **lots of funny “[Oh shit Git!](http://ohshitgit.com/)”** by doing it, and we definitely hope that you'll have no less pleasure in watching it now, while browsing our training projects.
