             - We are a group of students at the TiC course,as students of that course we have to fulfill our weekly targets, in particular this week we have covered a lot of basic aspects of Github, learned about Javascript and created a project that consists in this portfolio website.

                                                                        WHAT
            This site have to be our buisness card. Our presentation to possible clients. We wanted it clean , smooth and obiouvsly mobile first. We developed it in group on Github, this have improved our pair/group programming skills.

                                                                        HOW
            First we started making a html skeleton with the basics.Then we splitted the group in two couples , one of the couples worked mainly on build a responsive menu to navigate the site , the second worked on the structure and the content of the website.We managed to keep everything clean and working trough Github.                                                            




Week 1 - Project
Build a one-page portfolio website
In the first week we ask you to build your team's portfolio website.

You'll use the website you build here to showcase all the projects we'll build in the following weeks, so don't worry getting it perfect now, you'll have time to refine it.

With this project you should familiarise with these learning outcomes.

This project can be built in one big team.

Following, the user stories that should be satisfied.

Basic stories
As a potential client looking to hire a team of developers
I want to visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team

so that I get a concise description of what you have to offer me

As a potential client looking to hire a team of developers
I want to visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact'

so I can quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit

As a potential client looking to hire a team of developers
I want to be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information

So that the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards

As a potential client looking to hire a team of developers
I want to click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page

So that I can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded

As a potential client looking to hire a team of developers
I want to easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop

so that I can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in

Accessibility stories
As a visually impaired potential client
I would like to easily read and understand the text on your site

so I can understand the information available

As a blind potential client
I would like to easily understand how to navigate the site after my screen reader reads me the content of the site

so I can understand the information available

As a potential client with JavaScript disabled in their browser for security reasons
I would like to visit your site and get a similar experience to viewing your site on a modern browser with JavaScript enabled

so that I don't feel like I'm completely in the stone age

Stretch goals
You are free to define any stretch goals that you want. Add them as user stories in your project's README.

Here are a few to give you some starting ideas:

As a potential client on a mobile device
I would like to click on the hamburger icon to show the menu items

so that I can have a compact navigation and more space for content

As a potential client using mobile, tablet or desktop,
I would like to have the navigation sticking to the top of the window

so that I can always know the structure of the page

Build process
Your team needs to set up a new repository under your cohort's Github organisation and work together to commit changes to this repository.

Your repo should contain a README file with these three points -

WHY (describing the purpose)
WHAT (describing your site)
HOW (describing the journey to completion)
Your website should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your Linkedin, Github and Codewars accounts.

Technical requirements
Your project should be:

built without using frameworks or libraries
built mobile-first
published on Github pages
have a minimal but consistent CSS organisation
Would be nice if your project was:

tested and optimised for accessibility tools
This project is based on FAC's week-1 project
