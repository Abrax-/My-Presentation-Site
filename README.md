             - We are a group of students at the TiC course,as students of that course we have to fulfill our weekly targets, in particular this week we have covered a lot of basic aspects of Github, learned about Javascript and created a project that consists in this portfolio website.

                                                                        WHAT
            This site have to be our buisness card. Our presentation to possible clients. We wanted it clean , smooth and obiouvsly mobile first. We developed it in group on Github, this have improved our pair/group programming skills.

                                                                        HOW
            First we started making a html skeleton with the basics.Then we splitted the group in two couples , one of the couples worked mainly on build a responsive menu to navigate the site , the second worked on the structure and the content of the website.We managed to keep everything clean and working trough Github.
